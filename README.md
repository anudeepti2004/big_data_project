NYC Taxis

In this repository you will find a series of scripts designed to explore [NYC Taxi and Limousine data](http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml) (INSERT LINK) using pyspark.

To get a count of Valid and Invlaid values per column of data spanning 3 years, you need to run the submit_job bash script. This will give an individual out file for each column.

Command to run bash script: `sh submit_job.sh`
